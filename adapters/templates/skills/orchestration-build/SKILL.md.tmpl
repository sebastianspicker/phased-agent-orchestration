# /build - Coordinated Parallel Implementation ({{RUNNER_TITLE}} Adapter)

## Use this when
- Plan (and relevant drift checks) are complete.
- The user requests `/build` or implementation start.

## Model tiers
- Lead: high-capability coordinator
- Builders: fast worker models

## Semantic intent
- Separation of duties: lead coordinates and validates process; builders implement.
- Context minimization: each builder receives only its scoped work package.

## Input
- `.pipeline/runs/<run-id>/plan.json`

## Procedure

### 1. Dispatch scoped work packages
Launch one Task subagent per task group. Each builder receives only:
- its own task set,
- required file excerpts,
- relevant verification commands.
- Enforce `config.orchestration_policy.max_builders` and active budget constraints from pipeline state.

### 2. Supervise and unblock
Lead tracks progress, resolves blockers, and enforces ownership boundaries. Lead does not author production code.

### 3. Collect and verify outputs
After worker completion:
- validate acceptance criteria,
- execute verification commands,
- record deviations.

### 4. Run post-build plan conformance check
Execute `/pmatch` plan-vs-implementation verification.

### 5. Gate evaluation
Require:
- acceptance criteria satisfied,
- verification commands successful,
- no unresolved high-severity drift,
- tests passing.
- `coverage-min` requirement gate for MUST requirements remains satisfied after implementation changes.

Write gate output to:
- `.pipeline/runs/<run-id>/gates/build-gate.json`

## Context isolation requirements
Builders must not see:
- other task groups,
- full design history,
- other builders' intermediate outputs.

## Non-negotiables
- Lead coordinates only
- Ownership map is enforced
- Context leakage between builders is prohibited
