# Validation checklist (units + uncertainty)

- Dimensional analysis passes for each derived formula.
- Limiting cases behave as expected.
- Bounds/physical constraints enforced (e.g., positive radii, probabilities in [0,1]).
- Uncertainty propagation verified on a synthetic case with known result.
- Significant figures reflect uncertainty (avoid false precision).
