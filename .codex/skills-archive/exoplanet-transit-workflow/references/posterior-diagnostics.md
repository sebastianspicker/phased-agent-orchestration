# Posterior diagnostics checklist (starter)

- Convergence:
  - multiple chains agree (where applicable)
  - effective sample size is adequate for key parameters
- Trace plots show stationarity and mixing
- Autocorrelation length acceptable (or documented as limitation)
- Residual checks:
  - residuals show no obvious structure around transit
  - heteroskedasticity noted if present
- Posterior predictive checks:
  - simulated curves look like observed data in key summaries
- Sensitivity:
  - reasonable prior sensitivity check for high-leverage parameters
