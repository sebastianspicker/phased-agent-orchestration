# Post-boot verification checklist (starter)

- Kernel version matches intended (or rollback documented).
- Filesystems mounted as expected.
- Networking up; remote access verified.
- Critical services running.
- Logs checked for recurring boot/storage errors.
- Schedule a controlled reboot test if appropriate.
