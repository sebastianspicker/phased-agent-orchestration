# Audio feature extraction quality checklist

- Sample rate and channel policy documented.
- Window/hop sizes recorded for spectral features.
- Loudness ranges plausible and not clipped.
- Pitch tracking failures documented (unvoiced, noisy, polyphonic).
- Splits prevent near-duplicate leakage.
- Licensing and permissions recorded.
