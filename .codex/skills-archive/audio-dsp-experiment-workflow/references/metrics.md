# Objective metrics notes (starter)

Choose metrics aligned with the task; don’t overinterpret.

- SNR: useful for denoising and noise floor comparisons.
- THD: useful for distortion introduced by nonlinear processing.
- Crest factor: useful for dynamics changes and clipping risk.

Always record:
- sample rate
- windowing/FFT settings (if used)
- exact parameter values
