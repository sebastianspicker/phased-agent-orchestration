# Simulation validation checklist (starter)

- Analytic limit check exists (simple regime where expected output is known).
- Baseline regression test exists (detects accidental behavior drift).
- Performance budget documented (runtime/memory) and measured at least once.
- Stochastic variability characterized (confidence intervals across seeds).
