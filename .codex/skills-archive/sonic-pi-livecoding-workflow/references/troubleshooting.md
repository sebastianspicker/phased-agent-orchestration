# Sonic Pi live troubleshooting checklist

- No audio:
  - confirm output device
  - confirm system volume and monitoring path
- Distortion/clipping:
  - reduce master level; reduce stacked FX gains
- Timing drift:
  - re-anchor using cues; reduce per-loop complexity
- CPU spikes:
  - simplify FX chain; reduce polyphony/density; reuse samples
