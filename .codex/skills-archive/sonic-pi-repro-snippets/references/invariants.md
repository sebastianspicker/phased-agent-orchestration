# Musical invariants (starter)

Use invariants to keep snippets safe and teachable.

## Common invariants
- amplitude cap (avoid clipping)
- maximum event density (avoid CPU spikes)
- scale/chord constraint (avoid unintended dissonance in early exercises)
- stable tempo grid (unless explicitly teaching timing feel)

## How to “test”
- Run seeded demo and confirm:
  - no clipping indicators
  - CPU stays stable
  - the note-set remains within the intended scale/chord
  - the pattern length matches documented bar structure
