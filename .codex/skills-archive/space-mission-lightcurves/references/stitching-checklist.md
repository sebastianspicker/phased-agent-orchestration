# Stitching checklist (starter)

- Document segment boundaries and any offsets.
- Record the stitching method (offset correction, normalization, overlap handling).
- Confirm phase-folded signals are not created/removed by stitching.
- Run a sensitivity check: results with and without aggressive stitching choices.
