# Reporting checklist (Bayesian)

- Report:
  - median (or mean) + credible intervals
  - units and time standards
  - priors (or a reference to a prior table)
- Report derived quantities and how they were computed.
- Clearly separate:
  - statistical uncertainty
  - model uncertainty (noise model/systematics)
- Include limitations and known degeneracies.
