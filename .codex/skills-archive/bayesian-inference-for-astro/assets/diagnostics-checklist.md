# Bayesian diagnostics checklist (starter)

## Sampling configuration
- Random seed recorded:
- Chain count:
- Steps/burn-in:

## Chain diagnostics
- Trace plots inspected:
- ESS adequate for key parameters:
- Autocorrelation acceptable:
- Convergence indicators checked (tool-specific):

## Posterior predictive checks
- Simulated data matches key summaries:
- Residual structure explained or documented:

## Sensitivity
- Prior sensitivity check for high-leverage parameters:
- Alternative noise model considered (if needed):
