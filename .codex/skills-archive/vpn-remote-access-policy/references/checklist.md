# Remote access policy checklist (starter)

- Management plane is not reachable from the public internet by default.
- MFA/strong identity is required for privileged access where feasible.
- Access is least-privilege (roles map to networks/ports).
- Logs and retention are defined; anomalies are alertable.
- Break-glass process exists and is auditable.
- Exceptions have owner and expiry.
