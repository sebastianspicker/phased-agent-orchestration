# Observed vs inferred (guide)

## Observed (examples)
- Measured values reported directly (with uncertainties).
- Data properties (cadence, baseline, instrument).

## Inferred (examples)
- Model-dependent quantities (depends on priors/noise model/systematics).
- Population-level conclusions beyond the sample.

## Writing discipline
- Label inference as such (“we infer”, “model suggests”).
- Avoid implying causality when only correlation is shown.
- Ensure citation matches what the cited paper actually claims.
