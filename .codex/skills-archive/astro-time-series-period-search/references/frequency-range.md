# Frequency range guidance (starter)

Choose a frequency range with justification:

- Lower bound: limited by observation baseline (avoid claiming periods much longer than coverage without strong evidence).
- Upper bound: limited by cadence and exposure time (Nyquist-like considerations vary with uneven sampling).

Record:
- baseline duration
- min/median dt
- gaps and seasonal structure
