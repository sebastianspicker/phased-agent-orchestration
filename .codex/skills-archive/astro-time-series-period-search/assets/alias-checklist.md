# Alias checklist (starter)

For each candidate period, check:

- Sampling window function peak(s) near candidate frequency.
- Daily/annual aliases (if ground-based) plausible?
- Harmonics/subharmonics explain the peak?
- Phase-folded curve coherent across seasons/segments?
- Removing one season/segment changes the peak ranking?
- Candidate stable under reasonable preprocessing variations?
