# Uncertainty checks (starter)

- Compare residual RMS to median reported uncertainty.
- Check time-dependent changes (segments with larger scatter).
- Check correlation of uncertainties with sky background/airmass/seeing.
- If inflating errors:
  - document factor/model
  - propagate into final parameter uncertainties
