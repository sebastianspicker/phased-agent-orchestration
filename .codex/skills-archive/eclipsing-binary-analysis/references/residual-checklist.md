# Residual analysis checklist (starter)

- Residuals show no phase-dependent structure around eclipse (or structure explained).
- Residuals stable across seasons/segments.
- Timing residuals consistent with stated uncertainties (or inflation documented).
- Outliers are handled with a documented policy.
