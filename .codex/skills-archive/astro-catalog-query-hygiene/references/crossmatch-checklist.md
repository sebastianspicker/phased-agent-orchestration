# Crossmatch sanity checklist (starter)

- Coordinate frame and epoch documented.
- Match radius justified.
- Handle duplicates (many-to-one, one-to-many) explicitly.
- Record tie-breaking rules (closest, brightness, quality flags).
- Sensitivity check: how results change with radius ± small delta.
