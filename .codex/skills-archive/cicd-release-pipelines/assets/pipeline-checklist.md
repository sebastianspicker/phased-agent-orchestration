# CI/CD pipeline checklist (starter)

- Build is deterministic; artifact version recorded.
- Environments separated; promotion rules explicit.
- Secrets never logged; access is least-privileged.
- Approvals required for production changes.
- Verification steps exist (smoke tests + observability checks).
- Rollback plan exists and is documented.
