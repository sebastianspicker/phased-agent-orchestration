# Submission checklist (starter)

## Build
- PDF builds locally (`make pdf`) without errors.
- References compile (no “undefined” citations).
- Figures are present and legible.

## Consistency
- Terminology consistent across sections.
- Units and notation consistent.
- Abbreviations defined on first use.

## Compliance
- Venue template/format requirements followed (margins, font, anonymization).
- All claims that need citations have citations.
- Data/code/artifact availability statements included (if required).
