# Source quality rubric (lightweight)

Use this to decide how much weight to give a source.

## High confidence
- Peer-reviewed paper, well-cited survey, official standards/specs (RFCs), authoritative vendor docs for implementation details.
- Clear methodology, datasets described, limitations explicit.

## Medium confidence
- Preprints (arXiv) with solid methodology but limited validation.
- Reputable technical blog posts that include reproducible details and references.

## Low confidence
- Uncited blog posts, marketing pages, social media threads.
- Claims without data/methods.

## How to use
- Prefer high-confidence sources for strong claims.
- If a claim relies on medium/low confidence sources, label it and seek corroboration.
