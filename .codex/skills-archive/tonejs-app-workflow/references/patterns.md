# Tone.js patterns and pitfalls (starter)

- Start audio on explicit user gesture; handle resume after tab backgrounding.
- Use musical time strings consistently (bars:beats:sixteenths) vs seconds.
- Use a bounded polyphony strategy; avoid unbounded node creation.
- Prefer offline rendering for deterministic exports when feasible.
