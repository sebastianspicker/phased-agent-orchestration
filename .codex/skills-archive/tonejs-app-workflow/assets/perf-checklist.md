# Tone.js performance checklist (template)

- Polyphony bounded; voice stealing strategy defined.
- Nodes are disposed/disconnected when no longer needed.
- Visualizations throttled and do not block audio thread.
- Target device/browser tested (desktop + mobile).
- CPU headroom acceptable at “worst case” pattern density.
